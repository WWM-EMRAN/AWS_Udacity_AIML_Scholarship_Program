# AWS AI & ML Scholarship 
### Scholarship (Phase 1 and Phase 2) for 2 Udacity nanodegrees and AWS AI/ML Scholarship Mentoring Program   

### AWS AI & ML Scholarship 1 (Phase 1)

AWS AI & ML Scholarship (Scholarship 1) recipient for the nanodegree "AI Programming with Python" offered by Udacity (winter cohort 2023). 
AWS has offered the scholarship as part of successfully competing in the "AWS Deep Racer" challenge. Annually, 2,000 student candidates are offered this scholarship worth $4,000 USD to complete the nanodegree. 
The nanodegree involves developing Python programming, Deep Learning (DL) concepts, and applications. The Pytorch package has been used in image classification using the transformer and custom DL models.  


### AWS AI & ML Scholarship 2 (Phase 2)

AWS AI & ML Scholarship 2 (Scholarship 2) recipient for the nanodegree "AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals" offered by Udacity (2024). 
AWS has offered the scholarship as part of completing the previous nanodegree ("AI Programming with Python") successfully provided under AWS AI & ML Scholarship 1. The top 500 participants from the previous nanodegree are selected for this scholarship (scholarship 2) to complete another nanodegree worth more than $4,000 USD to complete the nanodegree.


### AWS AI & ML Scholarship Mentoring Program 

This mentorship program has been offered for a year, as part of AWS AI/ML Scholarship 2 (Phase 2). A dedicated mentor from the AWS team has been assigned to have a 1-to-1 monthly meeting to help the student push forward to an AI/ML career. It includes guidelines for AWS certification and a free certification (practitioner) exam opportunity.

This nanodegree consists of 4 courses:
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. Introduction to Deep Learning
3. Convolutional Neural Networks
4. Developing your First ML Workflow

The major concepts taught: Machine Learning (ML) and deep Learning (DL) concepts and implementation with Pytorch. Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) and transformer models (AlexNet, ResNet) for image classification. Implementation of ML and DL models using Autogluon. Developing and automating (CI/CD) ML/DL workflow in AWS.



### 2.3. Project Details 
This nanodegree includes 4 computer vision projects to be solved using Deep Learning (DL) methods and application of AWS cloud resources to streamline the data processing to deployment workflow.

- Project-1: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon: AutoGluon is an automated multi-model ML workspace to train and test ML models' performances. The popular traditional Bike Sharing prediction dataset from Keggle is applied to preprocess data, train and test ML model to observe the performance. The performance scores are then submitted and compared on Keggle. 
- Project-2: Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch: Using DL library PyTorch, popular MNIST hand-written digits classification using traditional deep neural network.
