Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Classification of the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed 
AlexNet 	= [Correct]		&	DOG/NOT_DOG-> dog 	& 	BREED-> german shepherd dog 
RestNet 	= [Correct]		&	DOG/NOT_DOG-> dog 	& 	BREED-> german shepherd dog  
VGG 		= [Correct]		&	DOG/NOT_DOG-> dog 	& 	BREED-> german shepherd dog 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Classification of the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg 
AlexNet 	= [Correct|Correct]		&	DOG/NOT_DOG-> dog|dog 		& 	BREED-> german shepherd dog|german shepherd dog 
RestNet 	= [Correct|Incorrect]	&	DOG/NOT_DOG-> dog|not_dog 	& 	BREED-> german shepherd dog|capuchin, ringtail, cebus capucinus
VGG 		= [Correct|Correct]		&	DOG/NOT_DOG-> dog|dog 		& 	BREED-> german shepherd dog|german shepherd dog 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Classification of the Animal_Name_01.jpg (Cat_01.jpg) and Object_Name_01.jpg (Bucket_01.jpg) 
AlexNet 	= [Correct|Correct]		&	CAT/BUCKET-> not_dog|not_dog 		& 	BREED-> tiger cat, cat|mailbag, postbag  
RestNet 	= [Correct|Correct]		&	CAT/BUCKET-> not_dog|not_dog 		& 	BREED-> tiger cat, cat|mailbag, postbag   
VGG 		= [Correct|Correct]		&	CAT/BUCKET-> not_dog|not_dog 		& 	BREED-> tiger cat, cat|bucket, pail  


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the observation above from the uploaded images VGG should be the best choice. If the answers to the questions 1-3 are observed deeply, it can be seen that, 
- RestNet failed to identify the DOG and its BREED for the rotated dog image, Dog_02.jpg [Q.2] 
- AlexNet on the other hand did identified DOGs and their BREEDs correctly, but cannot correctly identified the BREED of NOG_DOG unknown object (Bucket_01.jpg). [Q.3]
Thus VGG is the only architechture that identified all of the different types of animals/objects with their appropriate breeds/categories.
